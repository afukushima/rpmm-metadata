# RIKEN Plant Metabolomics Metadata (RPMM)

This dataset is designed to describe plant metabolome metadata, and used to develop [RIKEN Plant Metabolomics MetaDatabase](http://metabobank.riken.jp/) that publishes RIKEN's research data. The RIKEN PMM is based on the semantic web technology with Resource Description Framework (RDF) and SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL).

This repository contains the files that define the ontology. The overall ontology is organized in a collection of directories and files as follows:

- [ontology/core](ontology/core): contains 
  - the base ontology file: [RPMM_CORE.ttl](ontology/core/RPMM_CORE.ttl) that defines the classes and properties.

  - [rpmm-schema.pdf](schemaDiagram/core/rpmm-schema.pdf) shows the schema diagrams of the RPMM-CORE.
